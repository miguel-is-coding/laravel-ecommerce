# Laravel Ecommerce

## About

**Laravel Ecommerce** is my first approach in creating an Ecommerce platform by my own, just to test my Laravel skills, and learn new stuff in the process. In the end, my expectations are to create a current MVC project, and try to migrate it to a DDD structure (as it can happen in a real world project). This project started as I was doing a course from Codecourse ([this one](https://codecourse.com/courses/build-an-ecommerce-platform)), and I wanted to share with you my process.

## Features
TODO: Will add them as I do them ;)
